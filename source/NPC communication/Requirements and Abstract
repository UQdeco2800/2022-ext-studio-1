# Requirements
What this code will achieve is that when the player walks to the designated unit near the npc, a dialog box will pop up in front of the player, and the pre-designed npc dialogue will appear on it. Among them, the npc dialogue will have several branches, and the player will be given different clues by choosing different options.
