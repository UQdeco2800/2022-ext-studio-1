PLAYER: She hurts so bad! We have to help her!

PLAYER: Why someone wants to kill Princess Nereus? What should we do?
RESEARCHER: Dr. (Player Name), we have to catch the killer who did this to Nereus. We all know that Nereus’s scale will contain her memory for 3 days, so we have to collect more of her scales to find out the truth, and save our home Atlantics before it falls!
PLAYER: You are right. Let's move now. We only have 3 days.
