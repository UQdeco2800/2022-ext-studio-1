Nereus' father was the king of Atlantis, but he stepped down from the throne a few years ago for health reasons and lost voice about heir to the throne as a result.
Her mom was also in charge of the main regime in Atlantis and had high admiration among villagers out of her shrewdness and broad perspective. Also, her mom loved Nereus for her talent of leadership.
However, their son Ares has strong skills in swordsmanship , but is not good enough in other decisive aspects especially to be the guardian of Atlantis.
You: "Orpheus, it is the information I collected about Nereus' family, but I don't know what this has to do with the murderer."
Orpheus: "We can sort out the clues together. Have you seen anything strange lately"
You: "It occurred to me that I saw Huff yelling at some troublemakers on the way to the theater that the princess' death had nothing to do with him."
Orpheus: "But those who loved the princess very much asserted that he was the murderer because he always showed violence to those with whom he had some skirmishes."
Orpheus: "Heph also disagrees with the political philosophy of the princess. He prefers Ares because Ares has more powerful strength and superb swordsmanship, which was he admired for."
Orpheus: "I also heard Nereus' parents were quarreling about the guardian of Atlantis on the way to theatre, and Nereus was sobbing softly."
Orpheus: "I felt very sad and just walked away pretending not to hear because I didn't want to show any affection."
Orpheus: "Having talked so much, I hope you can help me find the murderer of Nereus. I can give you my scale, but in exchange you can't divulge our conversation tonight."
