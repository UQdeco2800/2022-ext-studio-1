The people arguing on the street caught player's attention. As they walked through the crowd, they saw one man screaming at another person, with eyes blazing with fury.
You: "Hey guys, what's going on here now?"
Bystander: "Heph's weird temper, who knows what will happen."
"Maybe that person is not satisfied with what he repaired, Heph's repair skills are still good. Just a bad temper."
