You: "Orpheus... I'm sorry but Nereus is dead..."
Orpheus: "I can't accept it... I have not even show my love for her..."
Orpheus: "............"
Orpheus: "Well, I think it's meant to be."
(Orpheus clenched his scale in the palm of his hand)
You: "I know you're down, but it's only through the scales that we can find the murderer... so can you give me the scale on your hand?"
Orpheus: "You need to give me some information about Nereus' family in exchange. I think it may be related to her death."
