???: "Doctor! Wake up!"
You: "Ugh...What happened...Why the power is off? Zoe, is that you? Are you okay? It's too dark now, I have to restore the power."
Go to the electric switch.
You are at the electric switch.
You: "This does not look right...but I have to fix it first anyway."
Collect 3 batteries to fix it.
Zoe: "No! It's Princess Nereus! She can't be dead! Princess Nereus is the guardian of Atlantis. If she dies, it means that Atlantis is about to sink!"
You: "She hurts so bad! We have to help her!"
(CLUE 1: THE BIGGEST WOUND IS ON HER WAIST, AND IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE HURT HER)
(CLUE 2: BLOODSTAIN ARE FROM OUTSIDE, SHE SEEMED TO HOBBLE HERE WITH ALL HER STRENGTH)
(CLUE 3: SHATTERED SCALE FROM NEREUS)
Zoe: "No...we are already too late."
You: "Why someone wants to kill Princess Nereus? What should we do?"
Zoe: "Doctor, we have to catch the killer who did this to Nereus. We all know that Nereus's scale will contain her memory for 3 days, so we have to collect more of her scales to find out the truth, and save our home Atlantis before it sinks!"
You: "You are right. Let's move now. We have only 3 days."
